5:58 PM 29-05-2023 João Menezes (jo.carvalho88@gmail.com) - Hi Daria, nice to meet you
1:54 PM 31-05-2023 Daria Aleshchenko (daleshchenko@insquad.com) - Likewise, João! I noticed that you have a strong background in full-stack development. We currently have a job opening that I believe would be a great fit for someone with your experience. Would you be interested in hearing more about it?
5:56 PM 12-06-2023 João Menezes (jo.carvalho88@gmail.com) - hi Daria, I am  actually strong as a backend developer, not a full-stack one. I have little experience with frontend as I worked with it for a year or so a long time ago.I&#039;m open to working as full stack though. I&#039;d like to get in touch with frontend again if that makes sense to you.
3:44 PM 13-06-2023 Daria Aleshchenko (daleshchenko@insquad.com) - Hi João, thanks for letting me know about your experience. We have several opportunities that are great for backend developers. However, before I can share them with you, I need you to complete our vetting process. It takes only an hour and will enable you to be matched with opportunities from hundreds of our clients. Here&#039;s the link to the platform: https://dev.insquad.com/. Let me know if you have any questions!
6:02 PM 13-06-2023 João Menezes (jo.carvalho88@gmail.com) - I&#039;ll let you know when I&#039;m done
