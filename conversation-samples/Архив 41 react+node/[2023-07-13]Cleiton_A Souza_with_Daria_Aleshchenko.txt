12:50 AM 24-05-2023 Cleiton A Souza (cleitaum1@gmail.com) - Hello Daria,I hope you&#039;re doing well. I apologize for the delay in my response. I was on vacation and upon returning, I had a lot of work to take care of at Aec.Currently, at Aec, I am responsible for managing cloud and DevOps solutions architecture for the three providers: AWS, GCP, and Azure, as well as applications in the datacenter. Regarding development, my current role involves writing prototypes to hand over to the development team for implementing cloud applications or even making improvements to legacy applications running in the datacenter.I found the position very interesting. I have a good understanding of Node.js, although I&#039;m not an expert in React, as I have only worked on a few projects related to that technology.I apologize if I seemed impolite, but I would like to know the annual salary range offered by this unicorn company.Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your response.
