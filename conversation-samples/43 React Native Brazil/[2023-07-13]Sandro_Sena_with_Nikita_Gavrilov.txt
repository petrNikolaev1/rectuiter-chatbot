8:31 PM 31-05-2023 Nikita Gavrilov (gavnikal@gmail.com) - Great to connect with you, Sandro! Just wanted to drop a quick message to see if you&#039;d be interested in a potential job opportunity. We have a client who is looking for a developer with your skillset and experience to work on a remote basis (React Native). If you&#039;re interested, could you send me your CV so we can review your experience and see if you&#039;re a match? Once we have your CV, we can provide you with more information about the job opportunity.
4:29 PM 12-06-2023 Sandro Sena (sandro340@hotmail.com) - Hi Nikita, thank you for reaching out, but I am not interested at this time.Good Lucky!
4:58 PM 16-06-2023 Nikita Gavrilov (gavnikal@gmail.com) - Hi Sandro! Thanks for your reply anyway! How about we keep in touch for future opportunities? We focus on working with US-based tech startups. You could become part of our talent base so that once you are open for offers and we have companies that would match your current requirements, we could quickly get in touch with you. All you need to do is go to dev.insquad.com, click Apply now and take a short quiz and coding test on your primary stack (those will take an hour of your time max). You will then need to upload your CV there and voila! - you are part of the Insquad talent base.Takes little time but could be useful in the future =)
