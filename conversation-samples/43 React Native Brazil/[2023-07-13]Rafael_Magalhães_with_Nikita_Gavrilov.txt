I wanted to follow up and see if you had a chance to review the potential job opportunity I mentioned earlier. If you&#039;re interested, I recommend checking out the details at the following link: https://dev.insquad.com/senior-mobile-engineer?utm_source=closely&amp;utm_campaign=43-react-native-brazil&amp;utm_content=landing. To enrol in the process you will need to click Apply now and take a short quiz and coding test. The coding solution is really essential for this vac, as the company checks it first (instead of providing test assignments and so on) You will then need to upload your CV on to the platform too.
