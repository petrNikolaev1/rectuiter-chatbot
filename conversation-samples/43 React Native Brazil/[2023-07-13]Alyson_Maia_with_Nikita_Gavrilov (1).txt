12:58 AM 01-07-2023 Alyson Maia (alyson-maia) - Hey, Nikita! I would like to leave feedback on the quiz. Some of the questions are dubious or poorly written. Take this one for example:
1:03 AM 01-07-2023 Alyson Maia (alyson-maia) - The questions ask if the lines of code are correct, and they are. The affirmation about the state not being reflected immediately is also true, but that does not make the code wrong. You can see a very similar example in React docs (https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#state).
1:05 AM 01-07-2023 Alyson Maia (alyson-maia) - So the answer to &quot;Is this correct?&quot; is &quot;Everything is correct&quot;. The &quot;no&quot; on the first option makes one think that there&#039;s something wrong, which there isn&#039;t.
1:07 AM 01-07-2023 Alyson Maia (alyson-maia) - Also, the quiz is focused on an old version of React. It asks a lot about features that are no longer used in recent versions. One that learned React in the last couple of years could not be familiar with features that are not even used in any recent code.
1:07 AM 01-07-2023 Alyson Maia (alyson-maia) - Hope that this feedback helps Insquad to improve the evaluation of candidates¬†üòÅ
2:13 PM 05-07-2023 Nikita Gavrilov (gavnikal@gmail.com) - Hi Alyson!¬† :) Thanks for your feedback. I will pass this information on to our team.
