9:18 PM 09-05-2023 Iagor Moraes (iagor-moraes) - Hey Nikita, I was debugging Insquad skills-backend service, as it runs graphql is common to left introspection open for production, is just a friendly advise for your tech team to do not let it open for production as any attacker can understand all the queries and mutations that the application may have.
9:20 PM 09-05-2023 Iagor Moraes (iagor-moraes) - about the tests, I&#039;ve done react and react native and uploaded my CV, unfortunately some code challenges were not related to the library/framework but to programming logic, some quiz question were not clear also, but other than that the product looks very interesting, congrats for the team!
