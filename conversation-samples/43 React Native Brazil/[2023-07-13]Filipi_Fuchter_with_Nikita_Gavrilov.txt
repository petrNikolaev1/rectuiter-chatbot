They are transforming the analytics space for creators and have already helped millions of YouTube creators take their channels to the next level — grow their views and subscribers. The startup is currently scaling the team with talented React Native engineers. After looking at your background, I think you’d be a great fit!Are you open to such an opportunity, Filipi?
