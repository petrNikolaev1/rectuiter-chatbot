Sounds interesting, however, right now I&#039;m not open to new opportunities. But, I&#039;m saving your contact to ping you when I think it&#039;s time for a new challenge.Thank you
11:17 AM 09-06-2023 Nikita Gavrilov (gavnikal@gmail.com) - Hi Anderson! Thanks for your reply anyway! How about we keep in touch for future opportunities? We focus on working with US-based tech startups. You could become part of our talent base so that once you are open for offers and we have companies that would match your current requirements, we could quickly get in touch with you. All you need to do is go to dev.insquad.com, click Apply now and take a short quiz and coding test on your primary stack (those will take an hour of your time max). You will then need to upload your CV there and voila! - you are part of the Insquad talent base.Takes little time but could be useful in the future =)
