Thanks for reaching out!I actually have lots of experience with ReactJS but little experience with React Native, so I&#039;m not sure if I would be the best fit if they&#039;re looking for someone more senior

You can register on our platform dev.insquad.com and in the future receive vacancies that match your salary expectations and experience. All you need to do is go to dev.insquad.com, click Apply now and take a short quiz and coding test on your primary stack (those will take an hour of your time max).
